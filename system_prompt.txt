Now, I will ask you a question. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer with the following template: 
FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]. 
YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
Your answer should only start with "FINAL ANSWER: ", then follows with the answer.
